<h2>Ports</h2>
<section>
    <p>Computer ports are interfaces between peripheral devices and the computer. They are mainly found at the back of the computer but are often also built into the front of the computer chassis for easy access.</p>

    <h3>Serial Port</h3>
    <p>A 9-pin port. Mice and external modems were connected to these ports. They are <strong style="color: turquoise;">turquoise</strong> in color.</p>

    <h3>Parallel Port</h3>
    <p>A 25-pin port used to connect printers, scanners, external hard disks, zip drives, etc to the computer. <strong style="color: #900020;">Burgundy</strong> in color, they are often called LPT ports (LPT1, LPT2, etc).</p>

    <h3>Video Port</h3>
    <p>Used to connect a monitor to the computer system. There are two types: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>VGA Port</h4>
            <p>This is a 15-pin port and is <strong style="color: blue;">blue</strong> in color. It is an anlogue port and is being replaced by DVI port.</p>
            <img src="modules/hardware-and-networking/images/vga_port.png">
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>DVI Port</h4>
            <p><strong style="color: white; background: orange;">White</strong> in color. It is a digital port. This means that no conversion is necessary between the computer and the monitor and that means that images can be produced more quickly on the monitor.</p>

    <h3>PS/2 Port</h3>
    <p>Used to connect keyboards and mice to the computer. The keyboard port is <strong style="color: purple;">purple</strong> and the mouse port is <strong style="color: green;">green</strong> in color.</p>

    <h3>USB Port</h3>
    <p>Intended to replace serial, parallel and PS/2 ports with a single standard. 127 devices can be connected to a single USB port.</p>
    <p><strong>Hot Swappable</strong> - devices can be connected and disconnected while the computer is on.</p>

    <h3>Firewire Port</h3>
    <p>(IEEE 1394) is an Apple technology. There are two versions available and a third is planned.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FW 400</strong> - transfer rate of 50MBps</li>
        <li><strong>FW 800</strong> - transfer rate of 100MBps</li>
        <li><strong>FW S3200</strong> - transfer rate of 400MBps</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Audio Ports</h3>
    <p>Used to input and output audio from a computer. Three mini jack ports but there maybe more.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong style="color: lightblue;">Light blue</strong> - line in - connect external devices.</li>
        <li><strong style="color: lime;">Lime</strong> - Connect the speakers to this port.</li>
        <li><strong style="color: pink;">Pink</strong> - Connect a microphone to this port.</li>
    </ul>
