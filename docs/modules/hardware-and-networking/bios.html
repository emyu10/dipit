<h2>BIOS</h2>
<section>
    <ul>
        <li>BIOS is a term that stands for Basic Input Output System.</li>
        <li>BIOS is really the link between hardware and software in a system.</li>
        <li>The BIOS is boot firmware, designed to be the first code run by a PC when powered on.</li>
        <li>In 2003, Intel introduced UEFI. UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is meant to completely replace BIOS.</li>
        <li>UEFI is actually another small Operating System that interfaces between the hardware and Windows.</li>

    <h3>BIOS Basics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The combination of the motherboard BIOS, the adapter card BIOS, and the device drivers loaded from disk contribute to the BIOS as a whole.</li>
        <li>The portion of the BIOS contained in ROM chips both on the motherboard and in some adapter cards is sometimes called <em>firmware</em>, which is a name given to software stored in chips rather than on disk.</li>
        <li>
            <p>The BIOS in a PC comes from three possible sources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Motherboard ROM</li>
                <li>Adapter card ROM (such as that found on a video card)</li>
                <li>Loaded into RAM from disk (device drivers)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When you turn on your computer, the BIOS does several things.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Check the CMOS Setup for custom settings</li>
        <li>Load the interrupt handlers and device drivers</li>
        <li>Initialize registers and power management</li>
        <li>Perform the power-on self-test (POST)</li>
        <li>Display system settings</li>
        <li>Determine which devices are bootable</li>
        <li>Initiate the bootstrap sequence</li>
    </ol>
