						<p>With so many different overwater resorts to choose from within the Maldives alone, you should have no problem finding one that not only fits your budget, but your vacation style as well. This is because you'll find that Maldives resorts come in three different price ranges- budget, luxury, and super luxury. You'll also note that these same resorts either cater only to romantic couples or to a combination of couples and small families.</p>
						
						<p>If you're looking for a resort that caters to both couples and families and don't mind spending a good amount of money per night, then you'll want to take a long look at the Anantara Dhigu Resort & Spa. At this resort you'll find beautiful (and large) overwater rooms, lots of dining options, a kids club, wedding facilities and much more starting out at US$1,350 per night for two people.</p>

						<p>Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton will reopen on February 11, the hotel said Sunday, more than three months after it became a holding place of princes and ministers detained in an anti-corruption purge.</p>
						<p>The luxury hotel was closed for business since the unprecedented probe was launched on November 4 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated his grip on power since his shock appointment as heir to the throne in June.</p>
						<p>A hotel receptionist reached by phone confirmed to AFP that room bookings were available from noon on February 11.</p>
						<p>Many of the high-profile suspects, including billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, have been released in recent weeks in exchange for what officials have dubbed financial settlements.</p>
