						<h2>Maldives govt. warns tour operators Fila resorts may cease operations</h2>
						<p>Government of Maldives has warned tour operators that resorts under Fila Group might cease operations.</p>
						
						<p>A statement issued by Tourism Ministry on January 30th, states that a temporary license was granted to Fila Group as the Group had pending payments to the state and by issuing the temporary license, the state had hoped the pending amounts would be paid. </p>
						
						<p>However, the statement said the actions of the group had confirmed they had no intention of doing so. </p>
						
						<p>It also added that Fila Group was defying the state and state agencies and encouraging their employees to protest in sight of their guests. </p>
						
						<p>Tourism Ministry warned that the state would not grant any reprieves for Fila Group in th future, after the present temporary license expires. Given this, the statement said, it was likely that Fila Group resorts might cease their operations.</p>

						<h2>Why Chinese and Indian celebrities love this Maldives resort</h2>
						<p>What is it? An exclusive five-star resort on a private island in the Maldives fringed by palm trees and white-sand beaches and lapped by crystal-clear seas.</p>
						
						<p>And what makes it different from all the other exclusive five-star resorts on a private island in the Maldives fringed by palm trees and white-sand beaches and lapped by crystal-clear seas? OK, there are a few – more than 100, in fact, with some 25 opening in the past year and tourism arrivals rising even faster than sea levels. But this one does have the benefit of splendid isolation. It’s at the northernmost tip of the Maldives and is actually closer to India than the country’s capital, Malé. (It takes a 320km seaplane transfer to get here.)</p>
						
						<p>Unlike the less remote resorts, there are no boats and seaplanes buzzing by every few minutes. So you can pad around in a state of undress on your sea-view patio without the fear of snap-happy daytrippers disrupting your reverie. You are more likely to scandalise a school of passing dolphins.</p>
						
						<p>Who visits? Comfortably off types, mostly. Recent guests have included British pop star Noel Gallagher, Portuguese soccer legend Luis Figo and a veritable galaxy of Chinese and Indian film stars. JA Manafaru is popular, too, with well-heeled Chinese tourists, who have been a huge factor in the growth of tourism in the Maldives. This is why it has Mandarin-speaking staff, a Chinese chef, life vests to wear while snorkelling and direction signs in Chinese as well as English.</p>
						
						<p>They need direction signs on a tiny island? Surprisingly, yes. It’s dense with lush undergrowth and it’s surprisingly easy to get lost on your way between the seven restaurants, bars, spa, gym and water sports centre scattered around its 14 hectares. And there are big-wheeled mountain bikes for every guest to meander confusedly around on.</p>
						
						<p>So why are the Maldives sinking? Conventional wisdom has it that global warming is to blame. However, I have a sneaking suspicion the process may be being speeded up ever so slightly by the sheer volume of alcohol on the islands.</p>
